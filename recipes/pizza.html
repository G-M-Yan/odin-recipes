    <h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>
    
    <p>This <strong>Chicago Deep Dish Pizza</strong> is so incredibly good. It's loaded with melty cheese on bottom, then topped with meat and marinara sauce.</p>
    <p>It's so fun that the layers are reversed! The cheese is on the bottom and the tomato sauce is on the top. Probably some of the best home-made pizza I have ever had. YUM!</p>

    <h2><ins>Steps</ins></h2>
    
    <h3>Preparing the Crust:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, put water (luke warm), then yeast, oil, cream of tartar, and sugar. Mix with your hand or whisk until yeast dissolves</li><br>

        <li>Pour in bread flour a little at a time. Mix with your hand or dough mixer. Just curve your hand like a dough hook, hold the bowl, and mix. Then, knead it until it gets firm. Add more flour if needed</li><br>

        <li>The secret is the kneading. Knead it for about 10 minutes straight. Then, roll it into a ball, and put it in a bowl with oil brushed in the sides. Cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Let sit overnight unrefrigerated. Only let it rise once. Portion and use</li><br>

    </ol>
    
    <h3>Pizza Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the tomatoes and sauce and place into a bowl. Using a potato masher or just your hands, mash the tomatoes up so that there are no chunks bigger around than a quarter</li><br>

        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and stir. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Do not use too much basil or oregano</li><br>

    </ol>
    
    <h3>Assembly:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 350</p>
            <p>Prepare your deep dish pizza pan (or a round cake pan with straight sides) by coating the inside of it with a very healthy coating of melted butter or oil</p>
            <p>Roll the dough out to about 3 inches larger than the bottom of the pan, then place inside the pan and pinch the dough up along the sides</p></li><br>

        <li>Now, sprinkle the cheese in (right on the crust)</li><br>

        <li>Bake in the oven until the crust is starting to brown and cheese is starting to bubble up through the sauce. The little edges of the pepperoni should also be starting to crisp (about 45 minutes)</li><br>
