    <h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>

    <p>The <strong>Authentic Italian Spaghetti</strong> recipe comes straight from Italy. Tomatoes, basil, onions, and carrots flavor the meat to make the perfect sauce! You can never go wrong with Italian-inspired meals, especially a good, hearty pasta.</p>
    <p>We love using fresh, garden tomatoes for our spaghetti sauce, and will often make homemade canned spaghetti sauce when we have an abundance of tomatoes so we can enjoy the bright, fresh flavor all year long.</p>

        <li>When tomatoes have softened and have started to release their juices (about 4-5 min) add basil, sugar, salt and pepper (if you are using whole tomatoes, mash them with a potato masher or spatula to release all their juices)</li><br>

        <li>Simmer for at least 3 hours (and up to 6 hours), stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer, the better. Important: tomatoes burn easily, so keep an eye on them and add water a little at a time to thin sauce if needed</li><br>
